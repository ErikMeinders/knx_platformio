## Tasks
1. Testing example compilation
   - Preparing library for publishing
   - Successfully compiled basic example for both platforms

2. Creating webpage example (In Progress)
   - Created new example based on basic example
   - Added WebSocket and LittleFS support
   - Implemented static webpage serving
   - Encountered issues with WebSocket dependencies and compilation

### Implementation Details
- Created complete web interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Implemented WebSocket server for real-time updates
- Added LittleFS support for serving static files
- Encountered compilation issues with WiFi dependencies

### Next Steps
- Resolve WebSocket library dependency issues
- Complete compilation for both ESP8266 and ESP32 platforms
- Test WebSocket functionality with the web interface

### Technical Learnings
1. WebSocket Implementation:
   - ArduinoWebsockets library requires specific WiFi header configurations
   - Different initialization approaches needed for ESP8266 vs ESP32

2. Build System:
   - Platform-specific WiFi library dependencies need explicit inclusion
   - LittleFS configuration varies between platforms

3. Architecture:
   - Separate concerns between web server, WebSocket server, and KNX functionality
   - Real-time updates require careful client connection management
